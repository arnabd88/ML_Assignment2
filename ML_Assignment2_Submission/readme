data
  - the provided dataset

Assignment2.py
  - Main Source code 

func.py
  - contains the function definitions for perceptrons(all types) and some usable functions

run.sh
  - Run this file as below
   ./run.sh

	Execution of run.sh will generate the following files corresponding to different experiment questions

q31
 - Reports the results for the sanity check using table 2

q32
 - Reports the results for the simple perceptron and the margin perceptron across learning rates and margin values for single pass (corresponds to the requirements of question 3.3.2)

q33
 - Reports the results for the simple perceptron and the margin perceptron across learning artes and margin values in batch mode with and without shuffling of data

q3grad
 - Reports the results of the aggressive perceptron across different margin values in batch mode with and without shuffling of data
